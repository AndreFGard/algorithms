h(tree) = height if exists, 0 if only root element and -1 if no tree at all

Balance : h(left) - h(right), is balanced when we get to 2 or -2.
therefore, +1 = h(left) = h(right) + 1. +2 = h(right) + 2

R Rotation: key inserted in left subtree of left child of rt, the root of unbalanced tree,
with balance 2, that is, pending to left. we must rotate to right.

L Rotation: key in right subtree of right  child of the root of the unbalanbced tree with balance -2

Double rotations happen whe we insert an inner node (Rather than in the sides) and
    unbalance the tree.รง the first balance operation is
